# Welcome!

This is the 2nd version of the resume mini project from the Interactive Frontend Design module for CodeInstitute.

It integrates a few new features:

- Utilizes the Google Maps API to plot event locations on the "Interests" page
- Utilizes the Github API to allow a user to pull github repo information
- Utilizes EmailJS to enable the contact form to send emails

#### Notes:

- All CSS and HTML code has been validated by the W3C validators
- Errors in CSS regarding unknown vendor extensions are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that vendor extensions are proprietary and thus will always be invalid in standard CSS
- Errors in HTML regarding `dates` attributes on `<div>` tags are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that `dates` is a custom attribute used to style our CSS timeline
